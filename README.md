# ChatApp
Web chat app

The application should allow to send messages by typing the message in the compose box & clicking send (or enter) to send the same. 

Build an application such that on every load a new session id is generated. Basically, if the app is opened in a new tab or window then a unique session id needs to be registered for that session
The two or more sessions (chrome tabs/windows) now should be able to converse with each other.
The chat conversation data for each session can be stored in browser storage
•	user name: This denotes the user name of the current chat session. If the display name is empty then the messages have to be sent as an anonymous user.
•	Search: Search should be used to highlight specific words in messages as shown in the screenshot below
•	Filter: This should filter messages based on the message type. The message type here can be:
o	Text
o	HyperLink
o	Image
o	Video
